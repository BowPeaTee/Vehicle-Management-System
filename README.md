# Vehicle Management System

A Java-based Vehicle Management System designed to improve interaction between customers and dealers, created as part of my Semester 3 OOP Project.

### Overview:
* Dealers: Can add, delete, and manage their vehicle inventory and customer requests. They can also accept vehicle orders from customers and manage their own accounts.
* Customers: Can browse and search for vehicles, place orders, and view their accounts. All users can view the vehicle inventory.
* Data Management: The system does not include a database or file-based storage, so all data is lost upon closing the application.

### Implementation Details:
* Technologies: Java Applets and packages used for system design.
* Classes: 1. Dealer and Customer classes manage user information and interactions. 2. Vehicle class stores vehicle details, status, and ownership.
* Admin Controls: Admin system implemented to manage vectors and user information.
* User Management: Login and signup functionality for dealers and customers.
* Inheritance: Details class serves as a parent class for InfoDealer and InfoCustomer.
* UI Components: Utilized JPanels for functionality navigation and JTables for data display.
* Sorting: Implemented sorting in vehicle tables for efficient searching.
